            <p>Although Lewis originally conceived what would become 
                The Chronicles of Narnia in 1939 (the picture of a
                Faun with parcels in a snowy wood has a history dating
                to 1914). he did not finish writing the first book The 
                Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe until 1949. The Magician's
                Nephew, the penultimate book to be published, but the last 
                to be written, was completed in 1954. Lewis did not write the 
                books in the order in which they were originally published, 
                nor were they published in their current chronological order of 
                presentation. The original illustrator, Pauline Baynes, created 
                pen and ink drawings for the Narnia books that are still used in the 
                editions published today. Lewis was awarded the 1956 Carnegie Medal for 
                The Last Battle, the final book in the saga. The series was first referred 
                to as The Chronicles of Narnia by fellow children's author Roger Lancelyn Green 
                in March 1951, after he had read and discussed with Lewis his recently completed 
                fourth book The Silver Chair, originally entitled Night under Narnia.

            <h2 id="chapter1">Chapter-1: The Lion Witch and the Wardrobe</h2>
            <p>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, completed by the end of March 1949 
                and published by Geoffrey Bles in the United Kingdom on 16 October 1950, 
                tells the story of four ordinary children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy 
                Pevensie, Londoners who were evacuated to the English countryside following 
                the outbreak of World War II. They discover a wardrobe in Professor Digory 
                Kirke's house that leads to the magical land of Narnia. The Pevensie children 
                help Aslan, a talking lion, save Narnia from the evil White Witch, who has reigned 
                for a century of perpetual winter with no Christmas. The children become kings and 
                queens of this new-found land and establish the Golden Age of Narnia, leaving a 
                legacy to be rediscovered in later books.

            <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter-2: Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia</h2>
            <p>
                Completed after Christmas 1949[17] and published on 15 October 1951, 
                Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia tells the story of the Pevensie 
                children's second trip to Narnia, a year (on Earth) after their first. 
                They are drawn back by the power of Susan's horn, blown by Prince Caspian 
                to summon help in his hour of need. Narnia as they knew it is no more, 
                as 1,300 years have passed, their castle is in ruins, and all Narnians 
                have retreated so far within themselves that only Aslan's magic can wake 
                them. Caspian has fled into the woods to escape his uncle, Miraz, who 
                has usurped the throne. The children set out once again to save Narnia.

            <h2 id="chapter3">Chapter-3: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</h2>
            <p>
                Written between January and February 1950[18] and published on 15 September 
                1952, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader sees Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, along 
                with their priggish cousin, Eustace Scrubb, return to Narnia, three Narnian 
                years (and one Earth year) after their last departure. Once there, they join 
                Caspian's voyage on the ship Dawn Treader to find the seven lords who were 
                banished when Miraz took over the throne. This perilous journey brings them 
                face to face with many wonders and dangers as they sail toward Aslan's country 
                at the edge of the world.

            <h2 id="chapter4">Chapter-4: The Silver Chair</h2>
            <p>
                Completed at the beginning of March 1951[18] and published 7 September 1953, 
                The Silver Chair is the first Narnia book not involving the Pevensie children, 
                focusing instead on Eustace. Several months after The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, 
                Aslan calls Eustace back to Narnia along with his classmate Jill Pole. They are given 
                four signs to aid them in the search for Prince Caspian's son Rilian, who disappeared 
                ten years earlier on a quest to avenge his mother's death. Fifty years have passed in 
                Narnia since the events from The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; Eustace is still a child, 
                but Caspian, barely an adult in the previous book, is now an old man. Eustace and Jill, 
                with the help of Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle, face danger and betrayal on their quest to 
                find Rilian.

            <h2 id="chapter5">Chapter-5: The Horse and His Son</h2>
            <p>
                Begun in March and completed at the end of July 1950,[18] The Horse and His Boy was 
                published on 6 September 1954. The story takes place during the reign of the Pevensies 
                in Narnia, an era which begins and ends in the last chapter of The Lion, the Witch and 
                the Wardrobe. The protagonists, a young boy named Shasta and a talking horse named Bree, 
                both begin in bondage in the country of Calormen. By "chance", they meet and plan their 
                return to Narnia and freedom. Along the way they meet Aravis and her talking horse Hwin, 
                who are also fleeing to Narnia.

            <h2 id="chapter6">Chapter-6: The Magician's Newphew</h2>
            <p>
                Completed in February 1954[19] and published by Bodley Head in London on 2 May 1955, 
                The Magician's Nephew serves as a prequel and presents Narnia's origin story: how Aslan 
                created the world and how evil first entered it. Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer 
                stumble into different worlds by experimenting with magic rings given to them by Digory's
                uncle. In the dying world of Charn they awaken Queen Jadis, and another world turns out to 
                be the beginnings of the Narnian world (where Jadis later becomes the White Witch). The story 
                is set in 1900, when Digory was a 12-year-old boy. He is a middle-aged professor by the time 
                he hosts the Pevensie children in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe 40 years later.

            <h2 id="chapter7">Chapter-7: The Last Battle</h2>
            <p>
                Completed in March 1953[20] and published 4 September 1956, The Last Battle chronicles the 
                end of the world of Narnia. Approximately two hundred Narnia years after the events of The 
                Silver Chair, Jill and Eustace return to save Narnia from the ape Shift, who tricks Puzzle 
                the donkey into impersonating the lion Aslan, thereby precipitating a showdown between the 
                Calormenes and King Tirian. This leads to the end of Narnia as it is known throughout the 
                series, but allows Aslan to lead the characters to the "true" Narnia.
