The <b>Taj Mahal</b> is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river <strong>Yamuna</strong> in <i>Agra</i>, <em>Uttar Pradesh</em>, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, <ins>Mumtaz Mahal</ins>; it also houses the tomb of <u>Shah Jahan</u> himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, <small>which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</small>

<del>Construction</del> of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, <mark>on 6 February 1643</mark>, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The mausoleum was opened at that time to thousands of mourners.
